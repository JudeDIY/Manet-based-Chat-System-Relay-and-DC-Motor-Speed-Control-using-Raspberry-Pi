# Manet-based-Chat-System-Relay-and-DC-Motor-Speed-Control using Raspberry Pi
This project is visioned to provide a backup radio tower when all fails during any natural disaster where it can be used to communicate with people remotely using this network.

Lets get Started.

Step 1: Enable your SSH Mode in you Raspberry Pi.

Step 2: Now Enable Ad-Hoc mode in your Pi. Refer MANET Ad-Hoc

Step 3 : Setup a DHCP Server to auto assign IP for the Connecting Devices. Refer MANET DHCP

Step 4 : Reboot the Pi to Finalize all the Settings.

Step 5 : Now Execute the TCP Host program in the Pi.

Step 6 : Now Execute the TCP Client program in the Mobile. Important : Ad-Hoc Mode supports only on Apple Devices.

That's it.
